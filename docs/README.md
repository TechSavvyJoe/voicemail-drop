# GitHub Pages Static Site

This directory contains the static export of the voicemail-drop application for GitHub Pages deployment.

The site is automatically generated by running:

```bash
npm run deploy:github
```

This copies the Next.js static export from the `out/` directory to this `docs/` directory for GitHub Pages hosting.
