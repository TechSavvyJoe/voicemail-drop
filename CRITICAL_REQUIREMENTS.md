# Critical Production Requirements Summary

## üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. TCPA Compliance - LEGALLY REQUIRED
Your voicemail drop service **MUST** comply with TCPA regulations or you face lawsuits:

- **Opt-out mechanism**: Customers must be able to opt out immediately
- **Time restrictions**: No voicemails outside 8 AM - 9 PM local time
- **Do Not Call (DNC) list integration**: Check against federal DNC list
- **Consent tracking**: Prove customers consented to receive voicemails
- **Frequency limits**: Prevent spam (max 3 per month per number)

**Risk**: $500-$1,500 per illegal voicemail + class action lawsuits

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
Your app needs these critical env vars for production:

```bash
# Required for basic functionality
